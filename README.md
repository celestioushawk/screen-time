## Screen Time
Movie Library project allows you to discover movies, view movie details, search for movies and create and manage existing movies on the platform. It also allows you to view different cast and crew of the movies and view additional information on them. The project is built using Wordpress.

The Movie Library project includes creating a custom Wordpress plugin and theme which allows the movie library to function. Within the plugin, I have implemented custom post types, widgets, shortcodes, custom REST API endpoints, WP CLI commands, meta boxes for meta data input, rewrite rules and custom user roles.
